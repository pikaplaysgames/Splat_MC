# Splat_MC

Hey everyone! Welcome to SplatMC, a Minecraft mod used to add Splatoon in-game!
Eventually when we get to 1.0, **all** weapons and Splatoon related things will be avalible!
But for now I need your help!

# Currently Needed things

Okay so here goes:

* Need a way to shoot currently with the only weapon so far: The Splattershot.
* Need to make ink trails from the shots
* Weapon Parameters
* Code for Sub Weapons (future)
* Ink Tank code (future)
* Color changed for items and entities based on ink color

If you need any details, DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PikaPlaysgames), or email me at mannybuisnessthings@gmail.com

Stay fresh!!!
